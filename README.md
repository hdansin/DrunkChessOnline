# Drunk Chess


Chess but the pieces are too drunk to remember what they are.


## About


Drunk chess is a project that I am making for fun. It plays like normal chess with all the same movement rules and win conditions, except two random pieces switch every time the player makes a move. The pieces that switch are the player's own color, and the king cannot be one of them. Hopefully it is a fun variant that is not quite as competitive and is safe to play a little inebriated without worrying about your rating :).
